<h1><code>wthr</code></h1>
<p>A Cli app designed to give you the weather of any location</p>
<p>work in progress, currently working on handling the api response. Want it to look something like this:</p>
<p>$: wthr Berlin DE today </p>
<p>$: Sunny, 25 Degrees Celsius  </p>

<h2> to run </h2>
<p> in its current prototype state it requires an api key for openweather.org (this will be fixed shortly)</p>

<p>to run in its current state type the following in the command line:</p>
<code>cargo run "city id" "api key"
</code>

<p>valid city id's can be found in the citylist and api keys can be obtained by signing up to openweather.org</p>
