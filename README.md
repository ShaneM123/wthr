<h1><code>wthr</code></h1>
<p>A Cli app designed to give you the weather of any location</p>

<h2> to run </h2>
<p> in its current prototype state it requires rust installed and an api key for openweather.org (this will be fixed shortly)</p>

<p> firstly, please setup the backend <a ref="https://github.com/ShaneM123/wthr_backend">here.</a> </p>
<p>once the backend is up and running type the following in the command line:</p>
<code>cargo run York UK
</code>
<p></p>
<p> <code>2964180</code> is the city and city code and can be with one of your choosing.</p>
